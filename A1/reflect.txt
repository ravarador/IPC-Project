1. The first bug I encountered and fixed was after getting the last name. The program returned a run-time error with the description "Run-Time Check Failure #2 - Stack around the variable 'yesNo' was corrupted.". The probable cause of error was stated in the description so I analyzed and found that the format specifier in the scanf for yesNo is using a type string (%s) instead of the expected type character (%c). To fix the bug, I used "%c" instead of "%s" in the format specifier of scanf because too much data is written into the character variable if we used a string specifier for a character variable.
Bug code: scanf("%s%*c", &yesNo);
Fixed code: scanf("%c%*c", &yesNo);

The second bug I encountered and fixed was after the input of apartment number inquiry. The program was not showing "Please enter contact's apartment number: " even after inputting 'y' on the inquiry. I checked the code and found out that in the conditional statement (yesNo == "y" || yesNo == "Y"), double quotation marks were used instead of single quotations. The reason why it does not work with double quotations is because the value of yesNo is compared with the base address of the string literal inside the double quotations. To fix this, single quotation marks were used.
Bug code: if (yesNo == "y" || yesNo == "Y")
Fixed code: if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y')

The third bug I encountered and fixed was after getting the home phone number. The program was not showing "Please enter the contact's home phone number: " even after inputting 'Y' on the inquiry. The conditional statement was wrong as it was using 'AND' logical operator. To produce the correct output, I changed the 'AND' to 'OR' logical operator. The reason why I had to use 'OR' is because I only need one of the conditions to be true.
Bug code:  if (yesNo == 'y' && yesNo == 'Y') {
Fixed code: if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y') {

The fourth bug I encountered and fixed was after displaying the summary details, I saw that in the middle initial part, the 'lastname' was also printed. The bug was not easy to find but after multiple google searches and comparing the scanf codes, I found out that the "%6" in scanf specifier of middle initial indicates the size of the char array. As I checked the size of the middleInitial char array, I realized that it was smaller than what it was in the scanf specifier. My solution was to change the size of middleInitial array to 7.
Bug code:  char middleInitial[5];
Fixed code: char middleInitial[7];

2. Structures are stored sequentially in memory. In Contact struct, member name will always precede member address, and member address will always precede member numbers.
To show how Contact struct looks in memory:
struct Contact {
    name {
        firstName,
        middleInitial,
        lastName
    },
    address {
        streetNumber,
        street,
        apartmentNumber,
        postalCode,
        city
    },
    numbers {
        cell,
        home,
        business
    }
}

3. The repeated code in contacts.c is the code block inside the conditional statement for yesNo. To make the code cleaner and shorter, I will create a function specifically for displaying and input of integer.
The function will be like this: 
void getPhoneNumber(const char typeOfPhone[], char yesNo, char *destination) {
    int number = 0;
    if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y') {
        printf("Please enter the contact's %s number: ", typeOfPhone);
        scanf("%10[^\n]%*c", destination);
    }
}

I will replace the conditional statement including the code block inside with a one liner code that calls the getPhoneNumber function.
getPhoneNumber("cell phone", yesNo, &numbers->cell); //This will be for the cell phone
getPhoneNumber("home phone", yesNo, &numbers->home); //This will be for the home phone
getPhoneNumber("business phone", yesNo, &numbers->business); //This will be for the business phone

To explain more about the getPhoneNumber function, it will have the following parameters: a string for the typeOfPhone (this will be used for the display), a character yesNo (this will be used for the conditional statement), and a pointer address of type character (this will be used for assigning a value in that address). First, number is initialized to zero then a conditional statement will check if the yesNo input is Y or y. If it is true, it will go inside the code block, ask user for the number then store that number into the 'destination' address. If the condition is false, it will skip the code block of the condition and end the function.
The getPhoneNumber function will not return anything. 


4. "%*c" in scanf, means "read and ignore a character". An example is the "%30[^\n]%*c" specifier in the scanf of firstName. "%30[^\n]%*c" means it reads up to 30 characters ("%30") except ("[^\n]") newline character then reads but does not store the next character after [^\n] (%*c). The reason why "%*c" is used in some specifiers in the code is because some characters (like newline) must be read but cannot be stored to avoid bugs.

5. “%[^\n]” is used in scanf to read all except newline (^\n) while %s in scanf stops searching at the first whitespace character found. When mixed together, there will be conflict between "%s" and “%[^\n]” since newline (a whitespace character) will not be read hence searching will not stop as expected.
